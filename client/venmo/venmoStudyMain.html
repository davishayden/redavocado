            <p>
                The popular payment app, Venmo, allows users to send money from their bank account to another users for free. Venom payments are public by default (users can opt to hide payments but many, as you will see, are left public) meaning users can see every
                time another user pays someone. They don’t see the amount, but rather a message indicating what the payment was for. The Venmo fee is overflowing with payments as Venmo processed over $2.1 billion dollars in one of their recent quarterly
                reports. I wanted to know what people were paying for so I gathered 1,000,000 transactions (using their public API) between 4/22/2016 and 4/26/2016. I then sifted through the data to find any interesting patterns and trends.

                <p>The first thing I did was breakout every word/emoji used in a payment message and totaled all of them up for the entire dataset. The first interesting trend I spotted was the difference between the amount of times that Uber was mentioned
                    over Lyft or cab/taxi. The chart shows how big of a difference (nearly 4x) Uber is mentioned over Lyft or cabs. Although payment messages can sometimes be nothing related to what the payment actually for it would seem odd that in this
                    case people would be lying about about which ride-sharing service they were using. From this we can see that Venmo users prefer Uber over Lyft/cabs….by an extreme amount.</p>

                <p class=""> The date that I pulled this data was during Coachella time, so the fact that this shows up is not surprising. It also appears that Vegas is a travel mainstay for Venmo user destination.</p>

                <p>This chart contains certain Venmo terms that I found interesting or odd. I found cash interesting because it shows how payment apps have turned humans into peer-to-peer ATM’s. It would probably be a correct assumption that Drugs are not
                    actually drug related transactions. However, you can assume it would be much easier to sell anything when all you need is an app not a large quantity of cash on hand. Amazon showing up so many times probably indicates the sharing of
                    Amazon Prime memberships.</p>

                    While doing this study I found that many payment messages were just emojis. There were some pretty elaborate combinations but to make this chart I broke out the top 9 emojis by mention. Nothin on this list should shock anyone and reinforces that pizza
                    and beer are Venmo users food and drink of choice.</p>

                    This graph covers what sort of food Venmo users are paying each other for. Pizza and beer are probably a no-brainer considering the common perception of Venmo users is that they are of a younger age demographic. However, it looks like a great time to
                    start up a Thai or brunch restaurant. By collecting more data over time trends could be uncovered about what people are eating at different times of the week or year.</p>
