      The popular payment app, Venmo, allows users to send money from their bank account to another users for free. If you have never used it you should. Venmo payments are public by default meaning users can see every time another user pays someone. They don't see the amount, but rather a message indicating what the payment was for. Venmo has a view in its' app that allows all users to see all public payments from all users from their app. It is overflowing with payments as Venmo process over $2.1 billion dollars.

  <p> The chart to the left shows the massive difference in people paying others for using Uber. We can draw from this two important things with the first being Uber is the dominate ridesharing for Venmo users, which may be a younger crowd. Second is that the amount of people in an Uber car could be signficently higher than the amount of rides given. Of course this is expected, but to the magnitude the chart shows I would assume is higher than public perception. </p>

    <p> The date that I pulled this data was during the Coachella period, so the fact that this shows up is not suprising. It also appears that Vegas is a mainstay as a Venmo user destination.</p>

  <p> To the left are certain Venmo terms that I found interesting, funny, or odd.  Comcast might be neither of these and bae might be the most annoying terms used, but none the less it appears that the high Vegas count in the previous graph may be correlated with a few terms on this graph. </p>
